I'll help you simulate a later time on an EC2 instance. There are several approaches depending on your needs:
System Clock Modification
The most direct method is to use the date command to set the system time forward:
bash# Set to a specific date/time
sudo date -s "2026-02-15 14:30:00"

# Or advance by a relative amount
sudo date -s "+5 days"
sudo date -s "+2 hours"
However, you'll want to disable NTP/chrony first to prevent automatic time synchronization from reverting your changes:
bash# For systems using chronyd
sudo systemctl stop chronyd
sudo systemctl disable chronyd

# For systems using systemd-timesyncd
sudo systemctl stop systemd-timesyncd
sudo systemctl disable systemd-timesyncd

# Then set your desired time
sudo date -s "2026-03-01 10:00:00"
Application-Level Time Mocking
For testing specific applications without changing the system clock, you can use libfaketime:
bash# Install libfaketime
sudo yum install libfaketime  # Amazon Linux/RHEL
# or
sudo apt-get install faketime  # Ubuntu/Debian

# Run your application with a fake time
faketime '2026-06-01 15:00:00' your-application

# Or advance time by a relative amount
faketime '+30 days' python your_script.py
Important Considerations

SSL/TLS certificates: Future dates might cause certificate validation failures
Database connections: Timestamp-based queries and connections might behave unexpectedly
Logs and metrics: CloudWatch and other monitoring will show incorrect timestamps
Cron jobs: Scheduled tasks may trigger unexpectedly or not at all
IAM credentials: Temporary credentials might expire or appear invalid

For your database validation work with Impala/Kudu, if you're testing timestamp precision, libfaketime would be safer since it won't disrupt your database connections or SSL certificates while still allowing you to test how your application handles different timestamps.
Would you like help with a specific time-testing scenario?
